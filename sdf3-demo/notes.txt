Plan

* Spoofax Language Workbench = tool for making languages 
* Syntax + Semantics => IDE + interpreter
* Today: syntax => language-aware editor
* Syntax defined using context-free grammar ++

* original PaplJ grammar

* conversion to SDF3
* SDF3 productions
* abstract syntax trees (terms)
* algebraic signature

* convert to proper syntax (without all the parentheses)

* lexical ambiguities

* ambiguity
* declarative disambiguation rules
* pretty-printing (unparsing)






In this lecture I will demonstrate the use of 

* context-free grammars Spoofax

Given a context-free grammar, 

Spoofax generates a language-aware editor that

* checks syntactic correctness 
* provides syntax highlighting
* produces an abstract syntax tree 

We will interactively 

* construct a grammar for a small language 

and on the way encounter topics such as 

* ambiguity
* declarative disambiguation rules
* pretty-printing (unparsing)
* completion
