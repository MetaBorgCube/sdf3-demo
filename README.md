This project is developed to demonstrate syntax definition with SDF3. It features three variants of the syntax of PAPLJ, 
a small Java-like language used as assignment with the Shriram Krishnamurthi PAPL book.

* Language1: a syntax for the original s-expression language
* Language2: a more Java-like syntax with ambiguous expressions
* Language3: a Java-like syntax with disambiguated expressions using associativity and priority declarations

The `examples/` directory contains a bunch of examples in each language.

Switch between language by commenting out the appropriate line in `syntax/sdf3-demo.sdf3`.
